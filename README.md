This is a sentiment analysis on news headlines by using Bidirectional LSTM classifier.
The news headlines are annotated as positive, neutral or negative sentiment.

In this project, embedding layer is not used. This is to gain experience on convert the words to word embedding using Glove (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).
